```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
install.packages("tidytuesdayR")
library(shiny)
```

### Data call###
```{r}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2021-04-06')

forest_data <- tuesdata$forest
forest_area_data <-tuesdata$forest_area
brazil_forest_loss <-tuesdata$brazil_loss
soybean_farming <-tuesdata$soybean_use
vegtable_oil <-tuesdata$vegetable_oil
```

###Ideas###
1. A map of forest loss by country filterable by year (I have never done a map in R before)
2. Tree map (because we like those) of soybean use filterable by year and faceted by continent (means i will need to join in a continent list)
3. Forecast of future rainforest loss in Brazil for the next 10 years.
