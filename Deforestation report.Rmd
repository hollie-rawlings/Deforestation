# Introduction {-}

Across the world, demand for soy and soy products is surging. 
Soy production has increased 15 fold since 1950 and is driven by four main countries, Brazil, Argentina, China and the US. 
In recent years, soy has earned a poor reputation for both health and sustainability, but is this reputation justified? 

This report will look at the history of soy production, investigate its links to deforestation and to think about what the future of soy production looks like in a  sustainable world. 



# The ever changing demand for soy products {-}

```{r echo=FALSE}
continent_list <-read.csv("Continent_list.csv")

soybean_farming <- soybean_farming %>% 
  inner_join(continent_list,by=c("code"="Three_Letter_Country_Code"))%>%
  select(entity,code,year,human_food,animal_feed,processed,`ï..Continent_Name`)%>%
  rename(Continent=`ï..Continent_Name`)

continent_allocation <- soybean_farming %>% select(entity,Continent)%>%
  unique()
## These countries are 	Armenia,Azerbaijan,Cyprus,Georgia,Kazakhstan,Russia,Turkey 
## There are not many, so I can use a case when to recode them. 
## I'm no geography expert so I may not be right, If this were go go in a paper I would have to include a footnote about these allocations

soybean_farming <- soybean_farming %>% 
  mutate(Continent = case_when(
    entity == "Armenia" ~ "Europe",
    entity == "Azerbaijan" ~ "Asia", 
    entity == "Cyprus" ~ "Europe",

- Shiny widget showing demand for soy production over time split out by country (maybe an area chart?)
```{r}

```
# Is soy production linked to deforestaion? {-}

- Shiny widget map showing soy production hot-spots over time (maybe animated?)
- Shiny widget Next to graph of deforestation 

# What does the future of soy production look like? {-}
- Shiny widget forecast of future soy need 
- What can we do to protect our forests worldwide?
